# bond_spread_alert
The goal of this project is to send an alert when bond spreads (the difference between rates of return on different bond maturities).  Several studies (see those from the Fed @ St. Louis, for example) have identified the value behind knowing this.  I've kept and eye on these spreads for some time, and so I was interested in automating my daily research on the subject.
